<h3>Dear team-mate of EPAM!</h3>
<p>I am waiting for <b>Junior Java Mentoring Programm</b> for a long time. My goal was to take part of it previous year in May but unfortunately pandemy time has come. I am very happy that it starts again. I have a college degree in tourism, but I have realized that I am interested better in IT sector. My lifepartner works in IT sector and one of my friend is a java programmer so I decided to learn it on my own from tutorials from the internet. At the beginning I have found <b>hungarian video tutorial series "San Fransiscobol jottem"</b> (Krisz made it) and Krisz was the person with his humour together who motivated me and I realized that I love doing java and solving exercises.
</p>
<p><b>Alex Lee-s video tutorials and Telusko's videos</b> were also very useful. Beside these I have read a lot of tutorials on the internet for instance from these sites:
<ul>
<li><a href=" https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a></li>
<li><a href=" https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/">w3resource</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm">tutorialspoint</a></li>
<li><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/jatekosjavafeladatok/jdbc-alapok/foci-eb-1">java feladatok</a></li>
<li><a href = "https://www.webotlet.hu/?cat=99">webotlet.hu</a></li></ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Java Students Unit group on facebook</b> helped me also a lot. Many students has come with lot of exercises from Universitys and Courses and has asked for help. It was very useful for me  I have helped a lot to them so I could practice a lot. 
</p>
<p>
I went through a book called <b>Head First Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra.</b> It was a big jump to me.
</p>
<p>
My life partner recommend me to write a java programm. He wanted to sort our warranty papers. I have created the web application with <b>JSP, HTML, MYSQL(XAMPP), CSS, BOOTSTRAP, APACHE TOMCAT APPLICATION SERVER</b>  and there is a little bit of javascript code in it as well. 
</p>
<p>
Nowadays I began to learn <b>Spring Boot, Hibernate-JPA, ThymeLeaf.</b> I need a mentor now who helps me to reach my goal to be a java developer. 
</p>
<p>
Best regards,
